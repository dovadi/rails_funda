=== Upgrade to rspec-rails ????

== route_for

After a change to edge rails broke our monkey-patched #route_for method, I
decided to just delegate to rails' #assert_generates method. For most cases,
this will not present a problem, but for some it might. You'll know if you
upgrade and see any newly failing, route-related examples. Here are the things
that you might need to change.

* Make sure IDs are strings

If you had :id => 1 before, you need to change that to :id => "1"

  #old
  route_for(:controller => 'things', :action => 'show', :id => 1).should == "/things/1"
  
  #new
  route_for(:controller => 'things', :action => 'show', :id => "1").should == "/things/1"
  
* Convert paths for non-get methods to hashes

If you had an example with a route that requires post, put, or delete, you'll
need to declare that explicitly.

  #old
  route_for(:controller => 'things', :action => 'create').should == "/things"
  
  #new
  route_for(:controller => 'things', :action => 'create').should == {:path => "/things", :method => :post}
